# Graphs
# Graphs organize items in an interconnected network
# Each item is a node or vertex and the nodes are connected by edges

# Strengths
# Representing Links:
#   Graphs are ideal for cases where you're working with things that connect to other things

# Weaknesses
# Scaling Challenges:
#   Most graph algorithms are O(nlogn) or slower


# Directed or Undirected Graphs
# Directed Graphs
#   Edges point from the node at one to the node at the other end

# Undirected Graph
#   Edges simply connect the nodes at each end


# Cyclic or Acyclic
# Cyclic
#   If the graph contains an unbroken series of nodes with no repeating nodes or edges that connects back to itself

# Weighted or Unweighted
# Weighted:
#   Each edge has a "weight" - could represent the distance between two cities, or time it takes to travel between two distances

# Legal Coloring
# Graph Coloing:
#   Assign colors to each node in a graph
#   Legal coloring means no adjacent nodes have the same color
